# Challenges with Negation in Clinical Notes

A **clinical note** is written by a clinician or a healthcare professional when providing clinical care for patients. It describes patients, their history be it medical, family, socio-economic, dietary, hereditary etc., their present illness or condition, any findings from the physical exam that was carried out. It may also have details of lab tests that have been ordered, their results, the details of any procedures done, the medicines being taken by the patient and any dosage information.

Here's a sample clinical note.

*Patient is a 60 year old having difficulty in breathing.
Not diabetic. He feels that he has been in good health until this current episode.
Appetite - good. No chest pain. No weight loss or episodes of stomach pain.
Hypertension absent.*

## Negation
A typical clinical note in addition to reporting the conditions that the patient has, also reports the conditions that a patient does not have. This is important to have a better medical understanding of the patient. This is not something that you would see in a pronounced manner in regular language.

Examples of Negation

*Not diabetic. No chest pain. No weight loss or episodes of stomach pain.
Back ache absent.*

## Objective

Our objective is to identify the negations in the clinical note presented above. As stated earlier, negation allows for a more complete understanding of the patient.
